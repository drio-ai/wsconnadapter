# wsconnadapter
An adapter for representing WebSocket connection as a net.Conn
some caveats apply: https://github.com/gorilla/websocket/issues/441

Picked up just the adapter from https://github.com/function61/holepunch-server
Revision when file was picked up is 8f5e8775e813bbec97c09e7988c0c780486a9df2

The same file is present in a different repository here https://github.com/xandout/soxy
I am not sure if the holepunch-server and soxy are related or not. They are both distributed
with an Apache 2.0 license and are public.
